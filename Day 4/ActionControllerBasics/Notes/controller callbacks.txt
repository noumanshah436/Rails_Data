Filters are methods that are run "before", "after" or "around" a controller action.

*****************

Filters are inherited, so if you set a filter on ApplicationController, it will be run on every controller in your application.
"before" filters may halt the request cycle.

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :require_login

  private

  def require_login
    unless logged_in?
      flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
      redirect_to new_login_url # halts request cycle
    end
  end
end

*****************

You can prevent this filter from running before particular actions with skip_before_action:

class LoginsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:new, :create]
end

The :only option is used to skip this filter only for these actions, and there is also an :except option which works the other way.

around_action are more like append_before_action + prepend_after_action.

Internally, think of it like rails has two arrays, @before_actions and @after_actions.
 So when you declare around_action, it pushes/appends it to the end of @before_actions and it unshift/prepends to the @after_actions.

With a quick test as follows:

class SomeController < ApplicationController
  before_action :before_action
  after_action :after_action
  around_filter :around_action

  def before_action
    $stderr.puts "From before_action"
  end

  def after_action
    $stderr.puts "From after_action"
  end

  def around_action
    begin
      $stderr.puts "From around_action before yielding"
      yield
      $stderr.puts "From around_action after yielding"
    end
  end

  def index
  end
end


I got the following in the log:
