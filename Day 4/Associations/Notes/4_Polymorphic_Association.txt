we need Polymorphic Association when we multiple parent models are their for a single child
With polymorphic associations, a model can belong to more than one other model, on a single association.

For example, you might have a picture model that belongs to either an employee model or a product model.
If we do not use polimorphic association, we have a problem of missing foreig_key ( null=false  ) constraint of other model  ,
as we have only on parent associated with one record.

1)
Parents:
rails g model Article title:string text:text
rails g model News title:string text:text

Child:
rails g model Comment title:string commentable_type:string commentable_id:integer

rails db:migrate

2) add in comment model:
belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic:true

3) and in article and news model:
has_many :comments, as: :commentable


4)

article = Article.find(1)

article.comments.create(title: "comment for Article 1")
article.comments.create(title: "2nd comment ")

article.comments
article.comments[0].title

***

news = News.find(1)

news.comments.create(title: "comment for news 1")
news.comments                -- give array of all comments on this news
news.comments[0]             -- get first comment on that news

comment = Comment.last
comment.commentable
comment.commentable.title
comment.commentable.text
