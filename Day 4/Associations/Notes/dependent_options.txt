Docs are available here

Looks like the following options are supported:

nil - do nothing (default). if it is required to do nothing on deletion, nil (which is default behaviour) can also be used

:destroy - causes all the associated objects to also be destroyed.

:delete_all - causes all the associated objects to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not be executed).

:nullify - causes the foreign keys to be set to NULL. Callbacks are not executed.

:restrict_with_exception - causes an exception to be raised if there are any associated records.

:restrict_with_error - causes an error to be added to the owner if there are any associated objects.
