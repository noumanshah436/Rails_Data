In Self join association one model has relation with itself.
For example one user table can have list of all coach and player.
One coach can train many players. We will represent the association as:


rails g model User name:string

run migration:
add_column :users , :coach_id, :integer

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :players, :class_name => "User",  :foreign_key => "coach_id"
  belongs_to :coach, :class_name => "User"
end


user1 = User.create(name:"Player1")
user2 = User.create(name:"Player2")
user3 = User.create(name:"Player3")

coach1 = User.create(name:"coach1")

user1.coach = coach1
user1.save

user2.coach = coach1
user2.save

user3.coach = coach1
user3.save


coach1.players

user1.coach
