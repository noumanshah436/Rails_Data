I am applying all commands in friends folder

$ rails new friends

$ rails s   or  rails server

localhost:3000

127.0.0.1:3000

********************

To create a new controller, you will need to run the "controller" generator and tell it you want a controller called "home" with an action called "index", just like this:

$ rails g controller home index

home is the controller name
index is the action name ( )

http://localhost:3000/home/index

********************
to see all routes
$ rails routes 

********************

 partial files 

_header.html.erb

use _ before partial file name and include in file without _  

********************

Scaffold:

for CRUD operations we use scaffold:
$ rails g scaffold friends first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone:string twitter:string
( this will create all the CRUD functoinality )

$ pushing the migrations into the database( craete schema file):
rails db:migrate


delete this file as it is adding it own css:
scaffolds.scss

http://localhost:3000/friends

we need to use _path after prefix to create a link to that route

***************************************************************

devise gem:

Devise is the cornerstone gem for Ruby on Rails authentication. With Devise, creating a User that can log in and out of your application is so simple because Devise takes care of all the controllers necessary for user creation ( users_controller ) and for user sessions ( users_sessions_controller ).

Go to https://rubygems.org/   and search for devise

copy gem to gemfile 
Go to its doc at github https://github.com/heartcombo/devise

bundle install will install all the gems in the gemfile

rails generate devise:install

complete instructions

rails g devise:views

rails generate devise user    ( this is migration command )
rails db:migrate              ( migrate )

Add links to navbar and style each page with bootstrap

**********************
model is like database

views are web pages 

controller is like views in django

ctrl +c to break server

use two terminals open

for every web page we need a route
