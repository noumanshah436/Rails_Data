A Gemfile describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code.

*****************

gem lock file specified the version of each gem  used in the project, 
so whenever you run bundle install it will alway install that version specified

if you want to update the gem you can run 
bundle update dependency_name

to update all gems 
bundle update

**************************

you can pass version number in gem as the 2nd argument and it will always install that version of gem and
even the newer version is available bundle update will stick to that version

gem 'capistrano', '~> 2.11.2'

~> means that bundle update will update only the last number of version
for example:
 2.11.2  to 2.11.3
 2.11    to 2.12

**************************

require is used to specify what file should be used if the specified gem is not found 

**************************

bundle help

bundle outdated    - give list of all versions that can be updated

A manifest typically includes special comments, called directives, to add JavaScript files to a bundle.
