see docs 
add belongs_to and has_many to models in app>model>table
and run these commands

$ rails g migration add_user_id_to_friends user_id:integer:index
$ rails db:migrate

update form 

params in rails are the form fields

now we associate friends to user but each user has its own separate fried list
