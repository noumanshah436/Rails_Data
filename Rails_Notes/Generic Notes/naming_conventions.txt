General Ruby conventions


Class names are CamelCase.

Methods and variables are snake_case.

Methods with a ? suffix will return a boolean.

Methods with a ! suffix mean one of two things: either the method operates destructively in some fashion, or it will raise and exception instead of failing (such as Rails models' #save! vs. #save).

*******************************


Model class names :
	singular
	use CamelCase
        plural database table name.


Rails will plularize your tablename
Model name will automatically get pluralize in database


Model naming convention

Model/Class	Table/Schema
Article	articles
LineItem	line_items
Deer		deers
Mouse		mice
Person		people


rails g model  LineItem name 
will generate table with name line_items


Suppose you have Model name Book , it will store in sqlite as books and 
in model it will be class name as  Book

This will create a Book model, mapped to a books table at the database

Book.all
Book.new
@book.save
@book.update
@book.destroy


*********************************


Controllers : 
   use Plural name
   
   
   
   
   
*********************************

Route names are snake_case , and usually match the controller. Most of the time routes
are plural and use the plural resources .
