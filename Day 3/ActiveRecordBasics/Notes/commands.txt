******************************


delete any model

When you generate a model, it creates a database migration. If you run 'destroy' on that model, it will delete the migration file, but not the database table. So before run

bundle exec rails db:rollback
rails destroy model <model_name>
For rails versions before 5.0 and higher use rake instead of rails

bundle exec rake db:rollback
rails destroy model <model_name>
